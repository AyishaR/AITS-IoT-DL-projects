# AITS Projects

This is a compilation of my work done at [AITS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aitechsystems/).

The following are notebooks enlisting deep learning applications in IoT.

They were developed on the [cAInvas platform](http://cainvas.ai-tech.systems/) and used the [deepC](https://github.com/ai-techsystems/deepC) compiler to optimize them for EDGE devices.

Use the links below to run the notebooks on the cAInvas platform and use the deepC compiler.

The datasets required are hosted and available through links in the ipynb files.

*List of notebooks:*
